Introduction:
Energy inefficiency is a common problem in households and small businesses, resulting in high
electricity bills and unnecessary energy waste. Most users are unaware of which appliances
consume the most power or how to reduce their consumption effectively. Traditional energy audits
are costly and impractical for widespread use. With the advancement of AI, we can now build
intelligent, low-cost tools to guide users toward efficient energy use in real-time.
Problem Statement:
The project addresses the lack of accessible, real-time tools that help users understand and reduce
their electricity consumption. Existing solutions are either too generic (blogs, guides) or expensive
(manual audits, smart home systems). There's a need for an intelligent assistant that gives
personalized energy-saving advice using user inputs and appliance data.
Objective:
To develop an AI chatbot that interacts with users, understands their energy usage patterns,
classifies their consumption levels, and provides custom energy-saving tips tailored to
households or businesses. The tool aims to reduce energy costs and promote sustainable practices,
aligning with UN SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy.
